# Disinformation Resilience Simulation

These are the simulated model for my papaer:
Modeling Disinformation Resilience: How Social Pressure and Network Dynamics Drive and Sustain the Spread of False Narratives.
Details about the experiments and the paperâ€™s content will be disclosed upon acceptance.

# The structure

```model.py``` The script containing code of one round of diffusion simulation and the required formula, assigning some parameters, such as social pressure and network adaptability to a single run given the user settings, and calling the simulation.
